-- mySQL project - Data Cleaning

select *
from layoffs;


-- now when we are data cleaning we usually follow a few steps
-- 1. check for duplicates and remove any
-- 2. standardize data and fix errors
-- 3. Look at null values and see what 
-- 4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary - few ways

-- first thing we want to do is create a staging table. This is the one we will work in and clean the data. We want a table with the raw data in case something happens


CREATE TABLE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging 
LIKE world_layoffs.layoffs;

INSERT layoffs_staging 
SELECT * FROM world_layoffs.layoffs;

-- 1. Remove Duplicates

# First let's check for duplicates

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;

		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`) AS row_num

SELECT *

	SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,

			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1;

-- let's just look at oda to confirm
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
WHERE company = 'Oda';

-- it looks like these are all legitimate entries and shouldn't be deleted. We need to really look at every single row to be accurate

-- these are our real duplicates
